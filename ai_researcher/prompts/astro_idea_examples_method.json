	"Multi-Messenger Transient Classification": {
		"Problem": "Astronomical transients are detected across different wavelengths and messengers (electromagnetic, gravitational, neutrino), but current classification methods typically analyze each data stream independently.",
		"Existing Methods": "Current methods rely on wavelength-specific features extracted from light curves or spectra, and separate models are trained for different types of observations.",
		"Motivation": "Multi-messenger astronomy provides complementary information about the same astrophysical event, but integrating these diverse data types is challenging due to different sampling rates, sensitivities, and noise characteristics. A unified approach could dramatically improve our understanding of extreme cosmic events.",
		"Proposed Method": "We propose a novel framework that combines transformer architectures with physics-informed neural networks to jointly process multi-messenger observations. Our method first aligns temporal sequences across different messengers using attention mechanisms, then applies physics-based constraints that enforce consistency with known astrophysical processes. The model learns shared representations that capture the underlying physics while accounting for instrument-specific effects.",
		"Experiment Plan": "Test the method on a dataset combining gamma-ray bursts observed by multiple instruments (Swift, Fermi) along with potential gravitational wave counterparts from LIGO/Virgo. Compare classification accuracy and early detection capability against single-messenger approaches."
	},
	"Exoplanet Atmosphere Retrieval": {
		"Problem": "Current methods for retrieving exoplanet atmospheric compositions from transmission spectra face challenges with model degeneracies and computational inefficiency when dealing with high-dimensional parameter spaces.",
		"Existing Methods": "Traditional Bayesian retrieval techniques like Nested Sampling and MCMC explore the parameter space but become inefficient for complex atmospheric models with many parameters.",
		"Motivation": "With upcoming JWST observations providing unprecedented spectral precision, we need more efficient and accurate methods to interpret these data and break degeneracies between different atmospheric scenarios.",
		"Proposed Method": "We propose a novel hybrid approach combining machine learning emulators with differentiable physics models. Our method uses neural networks to quickly approximate the forward model of atmospheric radiative transfer, while maintaining differentiability to allow gradient-based inference. We incorporate physically-motivated priors based on equilibrium chemistry and incorporate uncertainty quantification through normalizing flows.",
		"Experiment Plan": "Validate the method on synthetic JWST transmission spectra and compare with traditional nested sampling approaches in terms of accuracy, posterior coverage, and computational efficiency. Then apply to actual JWST observations of benchmark exoplanets."
	},
	"Gravitational Microlensing Neural Search": {
		"Problem": "Detecting gravitational microlensing events in large-scale time-domain surveys is challenging due to their rarity, diverse light curve morphologies, and similarity to other variable phenomena.",
		"Existing Methods": "Current detection pipelines rely on template matching or statistical tests that look for specific light curve features, which can miss complex or noisy events.",
		"Motivation": "Microlensing provides a unique window into detecting exoplanets and isolated compact objects that are otherwise invisible. With upcoming surveys like Rubin Observatory LSST generating billions of light curves, we need more robust detection methods.",
		"Proposed Method": "We propose a hierarchical attention-based neural architecture specifically designed for irregular time series. The model first processes local temporal features using transformer encoders with positional encodings adapted for irregular sampling, then applies a novel causal attention mechanism that focuses on the critical regions of potential magnification events. We incorporate physical constraints from lens geometry to improve generalization to diverse event morphologies.",
		"Experiment Plan": "Evaluate on simulated microlensing events injected into real survey data from ZTF and compare detection efficiency against existing pipelines. Quantify performance on different types of lensing events including binary lenses and finite-source effects."
	},
	"Cosmic Web Reconstruction": {
		"Problem": "Mapping the three-dimensional cosmic web structure between galaxies is challenging due to sparse sampling of tracers and observational limitations.",
		"Existing Methods": "Current methods include density field reconstruction techniques from galaxy surveys and hydrodynamical simulations that predict gas distribution, but connecting observations to the underlying dark matter and gas distribution remains difficult.",
		"Motivation": "The cosmic web contains most of the universe's baryons in the form of diffuse gas that is difficult to observe directly. Better reconstruction methods would help locate the 'missing baryons' and understand galaxy formation in the context of their cosmic environment.",
		"Proposed Method": "We propose a physics-informed graph neural network approach that combines galaxy survey data with Lyman-alpha forest observations. Our model represents the cosmic web as a graph where nodes are observed galaxies and absorption systems, and edges represent predicted connections in the underlying web. The model is trained with a dual objective: matching known observations while respecting physical constraints from cosmological simulations through differentiable physics modules.",
		"Experiment Plan": "Validate the method using mock observations generated from hydrodynamical simulations, then apply to real data combining SDSS galaxy surveys with quasar absorption line measurements to produce a 3D map of the cosmic web."
	},
	"Dynamic Stellar Spectral Modeling": {
		"Problem": "Current stellar spectral analysis typically treats stars as static objects, but many show subtle time-varying spectral features due to activity, pulsations, or companions.",
		"Existing Methods": "Traditional approaches analyze individual spectra independently using model atmospheres or template matching, with temporal information treated separately if at all.",
		"Motivation": "Time-resolved spectroscopy contains valuable information about stellar physics, exoplanet atmospheres during transits, and binary star interactions, but current methods don't fully exploit this temporal dimension.",
		"Proposed Method": "We propose a novel neural architecture that jointly models spectral and temporal dimensions in stellar time-series spectroscopy. Our approach uses a combination of convolutional layers to capture spectral features and recurrent components with attention mechanisms to model temporal evolution. The network incorporates physical stellar parameters as latent variables constrained by stellar evolution models, allowing it to disentangle intrinsic stellar variability from transient phenomena like planet transits or flares.",
		"Experiment Plan": "Apply the method to time-series spectroscopy of active stars and transiting exoplanet systems from high-precision spectrographs like ESPRESSO and HARPS. Compare the detection efficiency of subtle transit features against traditional methods that analyze individual spectra."
	},
	"Cosmological Parameter Extraction": {
		"Problem": "Extracting cosmological parameters from large-scale structure surveys involves complex statistical analysis that typically relies on simplified two-point correlation functions, losing information from higher-order statistics.",
		"Existing Methods": "Current methods like MCMC sampling of likelihood functions based on power spectra are computationally expensive and often make simplifying assumptions about Gaussianity and scale separation.",
		"Motivation": "With next-generation surveys like Euclid and Rubin Observatory mapping billions of galaxies, we need more efficient and information-preserving methods to constrain cosmological parameters and test theories of gravity.",
		"Proposed Method": "We propose a novel simulation-based inference framework using neural density estimators that directly maps from observed galaxy distributions to posterior distributions over cosmological parameters. Our approach uses permutation-invariant neural architectures to process galaxy catalogs without information loss, combined with a hierarchical structure that incorporates relevant physical scales. We incorporate differentiable simulations of structure formation as part of the model to enforce physical consistency.",
		"Experiment Plan": "Validate on mock galaxy catalogs from numerical simulations across different cosmologies, then apply to real galaxy survey data from BOSS and DES to derive constraints on dark energy and modified gravity parameters."
